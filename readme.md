## Notes


- Used a clean, modern UI with high contrast purple tones for readability and aesthetic appeal.  
- Encountered challenges handling file uploads on free Render plans, which required creative handling of metadata and user feedback.  
- Leveraged team collaboration via GitHub and division of responsibilities across front-end, back-end, and DevOps.
